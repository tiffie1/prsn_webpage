# Visualized Latency
Version 0.37.4.


## Description

An informative network webpage for the [PRSN website](https://redsismica.uprm.edu/index.php).  
Will display each NTRIP station and their internet latency, visualized as a graph for trend analysis.  
The webpage will also include other important network information like maximum/minimum latency, root mean square (RMS), etc.

![WIP version of graph](https://github.com/tiffie1/prsn_webpage/assets/139599672/b4e60d4f-7bc4-4e04-bcde-8f8143c6dd7b)


## Roadmap

Currently, the webpage has not reached a full release version.  

A full release will have the following:
- Graphs that update automatically.
- Layout for the 30+ stations expected to be recorded.
- Station browser for ease of use.

Once completed, the project will be considered to have reached version 1.0.0.  
Additional updates beyond 1.0.0 will likely have optimizations on a varying amount of severity.


### Current Task

Organize files and prepare for further expansion.


### Completed

- Template for format.
- Graph creation.
